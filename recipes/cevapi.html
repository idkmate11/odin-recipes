    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      Best stuff ever. If you never had it, you're missing out. Real ones know.
      Best served with Kajmak or Ajvar, but sadly it ain't included in the
      picture.
    </p>
    <h1>Ćevapi - Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>600 g finely minced beef (1.3 pounds)</li>
      <br />

      <li>300g finely minced lamb (or pork mince if you prefer) (10 oz)</li>
      <br />

      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <br />

      <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
      <br />

      <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <br />
    </ul>
    <h1>Ćevapi - Step by Step Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine beef, lamb, and salt (plus other spices if you
        so desire)
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>Knead the mixture with clean hands for 5 minutes</li>
      <br />

      <li>Cover the meat with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight</li>
      <br />

      <li>Uncover the meat and stir in minced garlic and black pepper</li>
      <br />

      <li>
        Shape the mixture into small logs no longer or wider than an index
        finger – it is best to do this with wet hands, so the meat does not
        stick to you. Keep wetting your hands after each few that you roll
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>Preheat your grill. Ideally, you should use a charcoal grill</li>
      <br />

      <li>Brush the grill with some olive oil</li>
      <br />

      <li>
        Grill the minced fingers on a medium heat until evenly grilled and
        browned on all sides
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        Serve warm with Turkish flatbread and freshly chopped onion (and ajvar
        if you have it!)
      </li>
      <br />
    </ol>
